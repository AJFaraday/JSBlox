JS Blox
=======

Stress relief coding by Andrew Faraday.

It started with a vague idea about filling a div with coloured blocks, randomly generated on page load.

It's still that vague idea.

To use
------

Just open index.html

Parameters
----------

In index.html, you'll see these attributes being passed to JSBlox:

<pre>
  $(document).ready(function(){
    Blox = new JSBlox({
      width: 500, 
      height: 200,
      square_size: 10,
      max_squares: 5
    });
  });
</pre>

attribute  | meaning
-----------|--------
width      | The width of the holder, in pixels
height     | The height of the holder, in pixels 
square_size| The size of the small squares blocks are made out of
max_squares| The maximum number of squares along either side of a block
